> **Connecting students with students**

## Who We Are

mentora is an innovative educational platform that empowers students to become mentors and share their knowledge with fellow learners. We believe in the power of peer-to-peer learning, where students who have completed courses can become teachers themselves, creating a collaborative and sustainable learning ecosystem.

## Our Mission

To democratize education by creating a platform where students can learn from each other, turning successful learners into teachers and building a community-driven educational experience.

## What We Do

mentora provides a comprehensive learning platform where:

- **Students** can discover and enroll in video-based courses tailored to their academic needs
- **Mentors** (former students) can create and share their expertise through structured courses
- **Everyone** benefits from a peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing community

Our platform focuses on connecting students with relevant courses based on their university, faculty, and major, making education more accessible and personalized.

## Our Values

- **Student-First**: Everything we do is centered around the student learning experience
- **Peer Learning**: We believe students learn best from those who have walked the same path
- **Quality Education**: We maintain high standards for course content and mentor qualifications
